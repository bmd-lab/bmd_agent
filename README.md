# BMD Agent

BMD Agent is a small, deterministic observation and diagnostic layer for the
BMD Lab at Tel Aviv University. It helps researchers understand VASP
calculations without replacing the software and knowledge sources that produced
them.

BMD Agent observes and diagnoses calculations. It can inspect:

- VASP inputs and results;
- SLURM state, accounting, resource use, and out-of-memory evidence;
- Custodian interventions;
- BMD Compute workflow and Git provenance;
- compact convergence trajectories; and
- applicable contextual knowledge supplied by BMDex.

The default output is a concise student-facing diagnosis. Detailed evidence
remains available for advanced users and reproducibility.

## Install

BMD Agent requires Python 3.12 or newer. From a fresh clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmd-lab/bmd_agent.git
cd bmd_agent
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate the environment with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

For development, install the declared test dependency and run the suite:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest
```

No BMD Compute checkout, BMDex checkout, SSH connection, PowerSLURM access, or
VASP installation is required to run the unit tests.

## Configure resources

The tracked [example configuration](config/resources.example.toml) documents
the supported resource fields. Copy it to a deployment-local location and edit
the copy. The example is never used automatically for real execution.

The normal Linux location is:

```text
~/.config/bmd-agent/resources.toml
```

On Windows, the normal location is:

```text
%APPDATA%\bmd-agent\resources.toml
```

Set `BMD_AGENT_RESOURCES` to use a different file:

```bash
export BMD_AGENT_RESOURCES=/secure/local/path/resources.toml
```

Deployment configuration identifies resources; it does not define scientific
workflow policy. The main fields are:

- `repositories`: trusted BMD Compute and BMDex checkout paths;
- `capability_python`: the Python executable for each checkout's own
  environment;
- `ssh_host`: a configured SSH alias for the observational cluster identity;
- `allowed_remote_roots`: absolute POSIX roots authorized for remote reads;
- `deployment_profile`: an optional shipped infrastructure reference profile;
- timeout values for SSH, fixed remote commands, and scheduler accounting; and
- `access`, `protected`, and `live` declarations describing Agent policy.

Keep `resources.toml` local. Do not commit credentials, private keys, or
deployment-local configuration. SSH credentials belong in the user's SSH
configuration or agent, not in this repository or `resources.toml`.

## Use

The normal interface is deliberately simple:

```bash
bmd-agent
bmd-agent JOB_ID
bmd-agent PATH
```

- No target analyzes the current working directory.
- A bare positive decimal integer inspects that SLURM job and resolves its BMD
  Compute run when producer evidence permits.
- Any other existing filesystem path analyzes that calculation or workflow.

Examples:

```bash
cd /path/to/calculation
bmd-agent

bmd-agent 21853598
bmd-agent ./copied-calculation
```

Use `--verbose` for detailed evidence, provenance, parser limitations, and
scheduler accounting. On job inspection, use `--profile` for
developer-oriented acquisition and performance telemetry. Additional
expert/debug subcommands remain available for compatibility and testing, but
are not required for normal use.

BMD Agent remains independently callable on a cluster with these same commands.
Its Python interfaces may also be called by BMD Compute in the future, but this
repository does not implement that integration.

## Observation boundary

BMD Agent does not intentionally modify calculations, submit or cancel jobs,
restart calculations, alter scientific inputs, delete calculation files, or
extract Custodian error archives. It does not read POTCAR contents.

In particular, Agent does not provide commands to edit `INCAR`, `KPOINTS`, or
`POSCAR`, and it does not expose arbitrary user-controlled remote shell
execution. Remote scheduler and file operations are fixed-purpose observation
interfaces.

Safe deployment relies on all three of the following:

1. Agent's read-only, action-free implementation;
2. correctly configured `allowed_remote_roots`; and
3. appropriately restricted OS/SSH credentials and filesystem permissions.

Remote path authorization is lexical. It rejects paths outside configured
roots after POSIX normalization, but it is not a filesystem sandbox and does
not resolve every remote symlink before access. A symlink beneath an allowed
root may point outside that root if the SSH identity can follow it. Likewise,
`access = "read_only"` is an Agent policy declaration; it does not remove write
permission from the operating-system account. Deploy Agent with a
least-privileged observational identity and suitable server-side permissions.

BMD Agent invokes only fixed producer modules from explicitly configured BMD
Compute and BMDex checkouts, using each checkout's configured Python executable.
Those checkouts are trusted code dependencies: their module code executes with
the Agent caller's OS privileges. Do not configure arbitrary third-party
checkouts as producers.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the complete security model.

## Deployment profiles

[`src/bmd_agent/deployment_profiles/power.toml`](src/bmd_agent/deployment_profiles/power.toml)
is a versioned record of expected and observed POWER infrastructure facts. It
supports reproducibility and compatibility checks; its paths do not grant
access.

Deployment-local `resources.toml` remains authoritative for the SSH alias,
allowed roots, operational timeouts, and access policy. The current VM-to-POWER
SSH route is a supported deployment, not a promise about the final production
architecture.

## Scientific and ecosystem boundaries

BMD Agent preserves the responsibilities of independently version-controlled
BMD projects:

- **BMD Compute** owns what its VASP workflows execute.
- **BMDex** owns curated supporting scientific data and contextual evidence.
- **BMDwiki** owns human-oriented tutorials and explanations.
- **BMD Agent** connects evidence so researchers can understand and diagnose a
  calculation.

Implementation is not scientific validation, a completed job is not methodology
adoption, and Agent observations do not automatically become BMD standards.
Human scientific review and governance remain separate.
